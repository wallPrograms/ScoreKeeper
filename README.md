# ScoreKeeper

Simple score keeper app. No styled html or css. No complete DRY code. Concentrating on the Javascript code and the event listeners.

The users choose a winning score by entering it on the input field. The Javascript recognizes it using the "change" event listener. Once one of the users reaches the winning score, the user's score display turns green and the game stops.
The game is reset is the reset button is pressed or if the winning score input is changed.
